In doing so, an error was introduced that\n    changed the original behavior of the 'deleted' filter when used by\n    itself, in how it treated both soft- and hard-deleted instances the\n    same.\n    \n    The original merged patch did not include test coverage for the changes\n    made to the db api. This change fix the error so that the original\n    behavior of the 'deleted' filter is restored while also adding full\n    test coverage for the modifications to the db api that has already\n    merged.\n    \n    Finally, the support method create_instances_with_args() used by the\n    new tests was renamed create_instance_with_args() to reflect that\n    when called, it just creates a single instance.\n    \n    Resolves bug 1181865.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibb82af09d3876904455ca7c93e14e9722ed31d35\n",
